An ATM machine will have the following components.
    Bank with which ATM machine is connected to. 
    Bank will contain user account details and account pin codes. 
An ATM needs to connect with the Bank to authenticate the user. Bank will also contain information about the amount the user has with the bank.
The ATM machine will contain 3 buckets which can hold cash of nominations 100,200 and 500 having a maximum limit of 250 numbers of notes in each bucket.
For simplicity, user will enter account number instead of swiping card (or entering card number)
Each Account will have a pin code which is mandatory to transact amount for the account and Account balance

Initialize the ATM
As part of this step, the ATM needs to be initialized, and gets connected to the bank.
Bank needs to be initialized with a sample account (12 digit account number, PIN code and default balance) with details.
ATM needs to be initialized with 3 buckets having 50 denominations  already present in each bucket.
Authenticating User
Ask a user to enter account details (12 digit number)
Validate account details with the bank
Once the user Logs in successfully, print a message to enter the amount to be withdrawn.
Until the user enters the correct account number, the User session should not start and the Console application will keep on asking to enter the account number.
Allow User to withdraw cash from the ATM
Once a Bank customer’s account details gets validated, the option to Withdraw cash is provided.
User is asked to enter withdrawal amount
Once the user enters the amount, User is asked to enter a pin which gets validated with the bank along with the user's balance.
Write an algorithm to fulfill the user's entered amount with nominations present in the bucket.
If the amount can be fulfilled, display Cash withdrawal completed and deduct the amount from the User's balance.


Assumptions:
User accounts exist already, no need to create/register the user
We don’t expect you to create a database to hold the data and dummy data can be created if and when required
We don’t expect a web application here and all the business domain would remain in the same console application
